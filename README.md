# Acroneem 
Training & Simulation Equipment for Reservists and Armed Forces

## Features
- Send firing singnals
- receive firing signals
- when a firing signal is received, player is considered lost and can be resurrected by holding resurrect-button for 5 seconds.

## Component List
- main microcontroller - almost any type of Arduino or ESP will do
- IR Receiver Module (for detecting hits)
- IR Transmitter Module (for simulating weapon fire)
- Transistor (for contorlling IR transmitter)
- RGB LEDs (for visual feedback)
- Push Buttons (for user input)
- Resistors & Wires (for circuit connections)
- Breadboard (for prototyping)
- Battery Pack (for portable power supply)
- Miscellaneous hardware (screws, holders, straps for mounting)

## Tool List
- Arduino IDE (for programming the Arduino)
- Soldering Iron & Solder (for permanent circuit assembly)
- Wire Stripper & Cutter (for preparing wires)
- Multimeter (for debugging and testing)
- Screwdriver Set (for assembly)
- Computer with USB (for code uploading and testing)
- 3D Printing Software & Printer (optional, for custom enclosures)

## Caution: Laser/IR Safety
For the safety of all participants, it is crucial to use only eye-safe lasers/IR transmitters in this project. Ensure that all laser components comply with safety standards and regulations. Regular testing and maintenance are recommended to uphold safety measures. Class 1 (around 1 mw) lasers are considered eye-safe. 

## Battery Guide
Use rechargeable LiPo or NiMH batteries for optimal performance and sustainability.
Ensure batteries are properly rated for your components to prevent damage. Optimal voltage is around 3.3-5V.

## Getting Started

1. Assemble the hardware components as per the circuit diagrams provided in the repository.
2. Install Arduino IDE and load the provided sketches onto your Arduino board.
3. Rock n Roll!
